## Additional Features
1. Add links to jurisdiction websites. One sales tax accountant who tried out
   the app said it would be helpful if each search result contained hyperlinks 
   to the state, city, county, and special district taxing jurisdiction websites.
2. Break out the district taxes. Right now, all special district taxes are 
   lumped together. Instead, have a separate line saying each district name and
   its tax rate.
3. Ship from address. Sales tax rates can vary depending on where an item is
   shipped from. Add fields to the form so that the ship from address can be 
   entered as well. Make it only optional, however.
4. Product types. There are different tax rates for different types of products.
   For example, some states have special tax rates for groceries. Add a field on
   the form where the product type could be entered.
